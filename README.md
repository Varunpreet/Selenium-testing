# Testing(Automation)

I have attempted to perform automated testing on the official website of The Sparks Foundation using Selenium and java.

The code was written in Eclipse IDE.

Testing is performed on various elements. For example- Verfication of title of the page, checking presence of an image on a web page, verifying if a page contains a name or not, checking the presence of text fields on a web page, etc.
